# Introduction
Instagram stands as one of the world’s most influential social media platforms, connecting millions of users across diverse interests and industries. Professionals leverage Instagram for brand promotion, portfolio building, blogging, and content creation. However, as Instagram continuously updates its algorithms and features to enhance user experience, these changes often impact post visibility and reach — making it challenging for creators to maintain consistent growth.

To succeed sustainably on Instagram, data-driven decision-making is essential. By analyzing metrics such as impressions, reach sources, engagement rates, and follower growth, creators can uncover actionable insights that inform their content strategies.

This project demonstrates how Data Science can be applied to social media analytics — exploring relationships between engagement metrics, identifying key performance drivers, and providing insights that can help optimize content performance over time.
